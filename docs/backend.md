# AnimeBackend Documentation

`AnimeBackend` is a synchronous backend for fetching anime data, episodes, and playable streams using the `anipy_api`. It‚Äôs designed to be simple-ish, fast-ish, and fully compatible with a Textual-based frontend.

## Initialization

```python
from backend.backend import AnimeBackend

backend = AnimeBackend()
```

* **Description:**
  Creates a new backend instance with `AllAnimeProvider` as the default (and only) provider.

---

## Methods

### `get_anime_by_query(query: str) -> list[Anime]`

* **Description:**
  Search for anime by name.

* **Parameters:**

  * `query` ‚Äì The search string (anime title).

* **Returns:**

  * List of `Anime` objects if results are found.
  * Empty list if no results or an error occurs.

* **Notes:**

  * Skips search results missing critical fields (`id`, `url`).
  * Fully synchronous; safe to call from a Textual frontend.

```python
results = backend.get_anime_by_query("Blue Archive")
```

---

### `get_episodes(anime: Anime, preload: int = 10) -> list[int | float]`

* **Description:**
  Retrieves the episode list for the given anime in `SUB` language.
  Fetches full episode list in a **background thread** while returning an empty list immediately on first call.

* **Parameters:**

  * `anime` ‚Äì An instance of `Anime`.
  * `preload` ‚Äì Number of episodes to return immediately if cached (default 10).

* **Returns:**

  * List of episode numbers (int or float) from cache if available.
  * Empty list if the episode list is not yet fetched.

```python
episodes = backend.get_episodes(anime)
```

---

### `get_episode_stream(anime: Anime, episode: int, quality: int) -> ProviderStream | None`

* **Description:**
  Fetch a playable stream for a specific episode.

* **Parameters:**

  * `anime` ‚Äì An `Anime` instance.
  * `episode` ‚Äì Episode number.
  * `quality` ‚Äì Preferred quality (e.g., 720).

* **Returns:**

  * `ProviderStream` object if available.
  * `None` if the stream could not be fetched.

```python
stream = backend.get_episode_stream(anime, 1, 720)
```

---

### `play_episode(anime: Anime, episode: int, quality: str | int = 720) -> None`

* **Description:**
  Plays the selected episode using MPV.

* **Parameters:**

  * `anime` ‚Äì The `Anime` instance.
  * `episode` ‚Äì Episode number.
  * `quality` ‚Äì Preferred quality (`int` or `"worst"`/`"best"`).

* **Behavior:**

  * Uses `get_episode_stream` to fetch the video.
  * Initializes an MPV player and plays in fullscreen.
  * Runs synchronously; the function waits until playback finishes.

```python
backend.play_episode(anime, 1, 720)
```

---

## Caching & Behavior

* **Episode caching:** Fetched episodes are stored in `_episodes_cache`.
* **Lazy fetch:** First call to `get_episodes` spawns a background thread to fetch all episodes while returning immediately.
* **Fetch concurrency:** Only one fetch thread runs per anime at a time; repeated calls return cached results or empty list until fetch finishes.
* Fully synchronous API, safe for Textual frontends.
* Optimized for huge anime lists like One Piece without freezing the UI.

---

## Notes

* No logging in this version; completely silent backend.
* Designed to gracefully handle missing or malformed data from the provider.
* Simple caching reduces repeated API calls but still hits the provider if uncached.
* Stable, fast-ish, and minimal‚Äîwon‚Äôt crash for massive anime series.
* Honestly, it‚Äôs a bit of a Frankenstein backend, but it works üëç
